ModdingUtilities

A mod with some basic features that make some annoying parts of modding pq easier, like giving specific update functions for each part of the game. All you need to do to get started is derive your main mod class from `PatchQuestMod` instead of `MelonMod`. You'll still have access to all of melonloader's features but with some extra stuff.
