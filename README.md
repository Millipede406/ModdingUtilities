ModdingUtilities

A mod with some basic features that makes modding PatchQuest easier.

# For Players
In order to use ModdingUtilities, all you have to do is download the latest release from this page and then put it in your mods folder with any other mod you want. Some mods may require a specific version, which you can find in a similar way
# For Developers
ModdingUtilities makes developing mods easier, with features that do a lot of the annoying things for you, allowing you to just focus on modding the game. The mod is very bare-bones right now, but I do plan on adding many more features, so if you have any requests you can head to the issues page, or you could just fork this repo and add them yourself I guess. For a documentation on how to use this mod, head to the wiki tab.
